# Instructions:

You may use the batch file (compilers.bat), it's a shortcut for flex + bison + gcc and then runs the output file.
  
  --> But you have to make sure that the batch file (.bat), lexer file (.l), and parser file(.y) all have the same name.
  
  --> The output will be the same name + ".exe"
  
  --> Ex: test.l - test.y - test.bat => test.exe
